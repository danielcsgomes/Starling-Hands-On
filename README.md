Starling Hands On
=================

These are my experiments with Starling Framework.

To be able to test them you need to do three things:

 1. Create a new AS3 Project.
 2. Add to your build path the required libs including this one.
 3. Add the wmode = "direct" to your html template.
 
## Required Libs

 * Starling Framework: https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Framework
 * Stats: https://github.com/hi-res/hires.as3
 
 Add them to your Build Path.
