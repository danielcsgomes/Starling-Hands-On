Starling Hands On
=================

These are my experiments with Starling Framework.

To be able to test them you need to do two things:

 1. Add to your build path the required libs
 2. Add the wmode = "direct" to your html template.
 
## Required Libs

 * Starling Framework: https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Framework
 * Stats: https://github.com/hi-res/hires.as3
 
 Add them to your Build Path.
